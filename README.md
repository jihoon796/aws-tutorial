# Introduction to Amazon Web Services (AWS)

The goal of this tutorial is to help you set up several key AWS services on your local machine. 

Before we can get started, there are 5 acronyms you must be familiar with:
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- RDS (Relational Database Service)
- S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- EB (Elastic Beanstalk)
- SSH (Secure Shell)

**EC2**, or **Elastic Compute Cloud**, provides the backbone for all of AWS. Users can literally rent virtual computers on which to run computer applications. 

**RDS**, or **Relational Database Service**, is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Not only does it actually provide the database, it also takes care of many of the difficult or tedious management tasks of a relational database that will have to be done otherwise.

**S3**, or **Simple Storage Service**, is where you can store huge amounts of data (virtually unlimited) on the Amazon Cloud. Users pay only for the amount of storage they use. S3 is often used in conjunction with EC2, as there are limits to how much data can be stored in any EC2 instance. 

**EB**, or **Elastic Beanstalk**, is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) tool that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage web applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.

**SSH**, or **Secure Shell**, is a UNIX-based command interface and protocol for securely getting access to a remote computer. It is widely used by network administrators to control Web and other kinds of servers remotely. This is the most common way to access an EC2 instance.
