# Amazon Web Services (AWS) Tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to help you set up several key AWS services on your local machine. 

Before we can get started, there are 5 acronyms you must be familiar with:
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- RDS (Relational Database Service)
- S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- EB (Elastic Beanstalk)
- SSH (Secure Shell)

**EC2**, or **Elastic Compute Cloud**, provides the backbone for all of AWS. 
It allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications.
